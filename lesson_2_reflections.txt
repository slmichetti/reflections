What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a directory that is typically hidden from the user. It contains files from that directory and is needed in order to track the history of changes to those files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows me to add the items I choose to have their changes saved and documented. By using a staging area, it allows me to pick and choose files instead of having changes auto-saved before I'm ready. In addition, it allows me to save changes at selected and more logical intervals than an auto-save. The value I see in using a staging area is the flexibility it allows to save files as I'm ready or at a point of completion that makes sense to me to mark the changes. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area allows me to view the changes I am making compared to the most recent commit. By viewing those differences, I can confirm I have logical changes grouped together and not multiples before finalizing the commit. I am also able to use git diff (with no arguments) to verify any changes I've made that haven't been added to the staging area and need to be committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Using branches would be helpful in keeping my history organized by keeping internationalization segments separate; it would allow me to change data by location (ex NEXUS and code being different for different sites --removing pay modal), and would also be helpful as we test out new ideas to items that are in production that you'd need to keep intact until you determine if those changes should become the new master.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
 Since git is non-linear, a diagram allows me to map out where the different branches are and to see what changes I am working on in a commit that may not be connected to a branch and potentially lost if I open a master without connecting it or writing down its commit ID.
