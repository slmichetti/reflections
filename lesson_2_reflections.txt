What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a directory that is typically hidden from the user. It contains files from that directory and is needed in order to track the history of changes to those files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows me to add the items I choose to have their changes saved and documented. By using a staging area, it allows me to pick and choose files instead of having changes auto-saved before I'm ready. In addition, it allows me to save changes at selected and more logical intervals than an auto-save. The value I see in using a staging area is the flexibility it allows to save files as I'm ready or at a point of completion that makes sense to me to mark the changes.
