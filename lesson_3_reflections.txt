When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remote repository would be beneficial when working on a collaborative project, when needing to access files remotely, or
  when I have files I want to share with someone else for their review.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually, vs having Git do it automatically, is preferred becuase there could be conflicts of changes made in the remote vs local repos; there may also be files that I dont want to add.
